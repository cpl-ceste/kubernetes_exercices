  #this service is external

  ports:
    #service's internal port (80)
    #This is the port on the service itself. Itâ€™s the port that other pods within the cluster can use to access the service. When a pod sends a request to wordpress-service on port 80, the service routes the request to the appropriate pod.
    - port: 80
    #local port,  for accessing the service directly via the node's IP address and the specified node port (30080)
    #This is the port on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. It exposes the service to external traffic. When you access a node's IP address on port 30080, Kubernetes routes the traffic to the service port (80), which in turn forwards the traffic to the pods that the service targets.
